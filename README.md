# VGM player
Simple VGM player for the Sega Game Gear with an old Everdrive SD cart.

Plays non-compressed VGM files directly from the SD card of an old Everdrive GG.

You need the latest version of GBDK-2020, GNU Make, Python + Pillow package to compile this project. On windows you also need the linux subsystem, say, MSys2.

Maybe support Game Boy Everdrive X3 at some point.
